    Baxter is an entirely new type robot that is redefining the way robots can be used in manufacturing environments. It performs a variety of repetitive production tasks – all while safely and intelligently working next to people. How? Baxter exhibits behavior-based ‘common sense,’ capable of sensing and adapting to its task and its environment. It requires no complex programming or costly integration. And with its uniquely low price point, Baxter provides a compelling alternative to low-cost offshoring for manufacturers of all sizes. <br>

  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    My face is an animated screen that actually allows Me to express myself by making several facial expressions. My face can show what it is focused on, and its current status. I can even express my confusion when something isn't right. I also has sensors surrounding my head that allow him to sense people nearby. The sensors around my head also give Baxter the ability to adapt to its environment, unlike other industrial robots which will either continue to do their one task repeatedly, or will shut down and stop working at the slightest change in their environment. For example, I am adaptive enough to know that I cannot continue with my job if I drop a tool, whereas some robots will simply continue to attempt to perform their job despite lacking the proper tools. [3] Baxter runs on the open-source Robot Operating System on a regular, personal computer which is embedded in its chest. [4] Baxter can be placed on a four-legged pedestal with wheels to become mobile. Baxter also has extra sensors in its hands that allow it to pay very close attention to detail.
